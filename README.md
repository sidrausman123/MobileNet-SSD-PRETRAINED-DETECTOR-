# MobileNet-SSD-PRETRAINED-DETECTOR-
SSD-style image classification project built with TensorFlow and Keras using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model uses a lightweight CNN backbone and a single-shot classification head to predict object classes in one forward pass. Ideal for beginners to understand SSD concepts and CNN-based image classification.
